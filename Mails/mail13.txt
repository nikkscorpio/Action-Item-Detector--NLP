Would you help us to look into the purchase of some Dell desktop computers? I’d love to know what you recommend and once we have the shipment you will set them up for us at our UPC center. We are looking to purchase about 7 (or less) not exceeding a total price of $10,000. These computers will be for Training and Technical Assistance (T&TA) use. The link below has the info. for buying through USC. Can  you send a quote/what you found for me?
