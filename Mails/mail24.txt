Please read the bold information. One of the TRiO programs is offering a position over the summer to teach a computer science class. They were wondering if you would be available for the position but that is why I was asking  why you set  your schedule in the afternoon for certain days. It would require a commitment in the morning all week for a large part of the summer.
