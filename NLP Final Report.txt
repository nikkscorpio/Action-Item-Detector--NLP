1. Project Overview
* Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a system that picks out all the sentences from a email that are action 
items of the email receiver, i.e. they indicate what actions the receiver must perform as a follow-up after reading 
the email. Once these sentences are picked out, the system should also break down the action items into its 
constituent components(the action item description, the action item owner(recipient of the mail) and the action item
timeframe(time by which the action has to be completed)]

* Methodology
The main methodology adopted was POS tagging and Semantic Role Labeling. The following is a step-by-step overview of
the methodology:
- The task of detecting the receiver's action items in an email boils down to finding all those sentences
that ask the receiver to perform some task. This is equivalent to finding all those sentences in the mail that contain
a verb that indicates the task and the subject of the sentence as the email receiver. 

- A sentence tokenizer(NLTK) is used to tokenize and iterate over each sentence. During each of these iterations, we do
a word-by-word tokenization(again using NLTK) and assign part of speech tags to each of these words using the POS 
tagger(NLTK).

- The key challenge in detecting such sentences is to avoid detecting sentences that contain a verb and receiver as a 
subject but do not imply any action items. Such sentences usually have the verb in the past tense. So once the POS 
tagging is done, all those sentences which have verbs in the past tense are eliminated from consideration.

- A Semantic Role Labeler(PractNLPTools) detects the action item owner and the action item timeframe in a sentence
by tagging them with A0 and AM-TMP tags respectively. Once we confirm that the owner is the receiver, we mark that
sentence as cotaining an action item.

- The timeframe, owner and task description components are extracted using the Semantic Role Labeler and stored for
further use.

- We implemented all of this in a Python script that takes in a file and outputs a file(the names of both these files
should be passed as command line arguments to the script). The input file contains the body of the mail and the output
file contains the sentences that have action items.

* Evaluation
We evaluated our system manually by picking out the action items and comparing them against the action items returned by
the Python script that we developed. 
- We calculated the Precision = 	No. of correct action items detected
					____________________________________________
					No. of action items detected


- We calculated the Recall = 		No. of correct action items detected (detected by our system)
					____________________________________________________________________
						No. of actual action items(detected manually)

- We calculated the F-score = 2 * Precision * Recall
				_________________________
				Precision + Recall




3. Project Resources

* Our test data were drawn from our personal emails(50) as well as from the Enron email dataset(50)

* We used a POS Tagger from NLTK(http://www.nltk.org/install.html)

* We used a Semantic Role Labeler from PractNLPTools(https://pypi.python.org/pypi/practnlptools/1.0)
